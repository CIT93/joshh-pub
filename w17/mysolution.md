We would first need to set up the calculations for the points if a dishwasher and washing machine are present

9 times or more = 3 points
4-9 times = 2 points
1 to 3 times = 1 point

no dishwasher = 0 points

both = we would have to run them separately and then combine the sums

example: 
input:
dishwasher 5 uses
washing machine 12 uses
both exist

output:
dishwasher points = 2 ( this would be 0 if it wasn't present)
washing machine = 3
total 5

The solution ensures accurate calculations:

Dishwashers contribute 0 points if absent.
Washing machines are calculated independently.
The total remains 0 if both appliances are missing.
