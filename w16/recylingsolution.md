For this I would do either a drop down or a checkbox. I think the checkbox would be easier and look better.
For this if you click a box on your form you would minus points from the default of 24.

Example:
1. Start with 24 points
2. Subtract 4 points per item selected
    - Glass - 4 
    - Plastic - 4
    - Paper - 4
    - Food Waste - 4
Total Points = 16
3. Final Score = 24 - 16 = 8 (this is what would be added to your carbon footprint total)
